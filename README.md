Sentiment analysis driven debate website. Built at MHacks VI!

Controversiality isn't exactly hard to find on the web. It's no secret that no matter where you go on the internet, everyone argues everywhere about just about everything. But why leave it to chance? With weRgu ('We Argue'), we apply machine learning techniques like naive bayesian classification in order to find out _exactly_ what topics are controversial on Twitter, and what each side is saying about the matter in question.
