          <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);">Social networking application have grown so commonly used that they are now integral to the way in which every speaks. Discussion and debate are no strangers to social networking, and owing to social networking's prevalence, many user probably receive almost all of their information about controversial subjects from platforms like Twitter. Unfortunately, platforms like Twitter have a problem: they generally allow users to see only a single side of the story.
          
          weRgu recognizes the importance of presenting a holistic view of controversial subjects, and these subjects are by there very nature not black or white. We believe that intelligent discourse, such as is possible on weRgu could be a huge catalyst to tackling the big issues that face us today and tomorrow.</p>
