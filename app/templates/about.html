          <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);">Social networking applications have grown so commonly used that they are now integral to the way in which everyone communicates. Discussion and debate are no strangers to social networking, and owing to social networking's prevalence, many users receive almost all of their information about controversial subjects from platforms such as Twitter. Unfortunately, platforms like Twitter have a problem: users generally see just one side the of the story, the side their friends support.
          
          weRgu recognizes the importance of presenting a holistic view of controversial subjects. These subjects are by their very nature not black or white. We believe that intelligent discourse, such as is possible on weRgu could be a huge catalyst to tackling the big issues that face society.</p>
